# Disclaimer
This will not change any bot behavior, this will just add cosmetics to bots. This is a fork of the mod that removes the bot behavior modifications in order to be compatible with Flying Fox AI.

# Features
- Bots are given random items in their inventory (i.e Weapon Skins, Music Kits, Gloves, etc.)
