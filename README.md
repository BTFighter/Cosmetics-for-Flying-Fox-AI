# Edited Plugins

In here there are some plugins that I personality edited to add the features of those plugins to the BOTs. I'm using these edited plugins on a Local Server because on a public server I'll get a Token ban.

I edited the following plugins.

# [[CSGO] Gloves](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=299977)
- Made it so that it doesn't skip BOTs
- All the data is now saved and queried by name as BOTs don't have a SteamID

- The following is now added to the database
  - Team names from mp_teamname_1 and mp_teamname_2
  - Total damage in a match
  - Total 5k in a match
  - Total 4k in a match
  - Total 3k in a match

There's an improved BotProfile.db I've edited that is a mix of the one made by [tNzxX](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Bots-release#announcements/detail/1805285903706432497) and the other made by [lolznoboz](https://gamebanana.com/scripts/10308).

I also added all the NavMeshes of my maps and all the team logos I currently have.
