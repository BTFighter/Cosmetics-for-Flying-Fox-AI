# Disclaimer
No Bot Behaviors are changed with this mod, just adding cosmetic features to bots. This is just a fork of the mod that removes the bot behavior modifications in order to be compatible with Flying Fox AI.

# Features
- Bots are given random items in their inventory (i.e Weapon Skins, Music Kits, Gloves, etc.)
- Bots are given a random SteamID, mainly to give Bots avatars.
- Bots are given random ping.
- Disabling the ability for players to control bots, in order to prevent issues.
- And more that I might have forgotten.

# Files Not Included
**bot_stuff.smx** - Flying Fox AI is not compatible with plugins that edit Bot behaviors, plus this plugin heavily tanks performace.
**botmimic.smx and botmimic_menu.smx** - Not needed as bot_stuff.smx is not included.
