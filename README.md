# Disclaimer

**PLUGINS ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS**

This will not change any bot behavior, this will just add cosmetics to bots. This is a fork of the mod that removes the bot behavior modifications in order to be compatible with Flying Fox AI.

Also, all plugins here belong to their respective authors. I only complile plugins to make this possible.

# Features
- Bots are given random items in their inventory (i.e Weapon Skins, Music Kits, Gloves, etc.)
