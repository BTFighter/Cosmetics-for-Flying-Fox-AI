# Edited Plugins

In here there are some plugins that I personality edited to add the features of those plugins to the BOTs. I'm using these edited plugins on a Local Server because on a dedicated server I'll get a Token ban.

I edited the following plugins.

# [[ANY] Aimbot (Auto Aimer)](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=283342)
- Removed the Admin Only Option for the !aimbot command to use with another plugin that I created.
- Aimbot is not active when the player is holding an AWP
- Every shot has a chance to activate the aimbot

# [Franc1sco/Franug-CSGO-Gloves](https://github.com/Franc1sco/Franug-CSGO-Gloves)
- BOTs will get random gloves

# [SQL Matches](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=312488)
- The following is now added to the database
  - Team names from mp_teamname_1 and mp_teamname_2
  - Total damage in a match
  - Total 5k in a match
  - Total 4k in a match
  - Total 3k in a match
- The following is no longer added to the database
  - SteamIDs
  - Players from Spectators and with No team selected
  - Players alive
  - Money
  - Ping
  - Assists
  - MVPs
  - Score
  
# [[CSGO] Weapon & Knives (Skins, Name Tags, StatTrak, Wear/Float) [!ws !knife !nametag]](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=298770)
- Made it so that it doesn't skip BOTs
- All the data is now saved and queried by name as BOTs don't have a SteamID

# Other Files

There's an improved BotProfile.db I've edited that was also originally made by [tNzxX](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF6sK9PaONILzTd42baWxkA) and the BotProfile.db he made can be found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Bots-release#announcements/detail/1805285903706432497).

I also added all the NavMeshes of my maps and all the team logos I currently have.
