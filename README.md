# Edited Plugins

In here there are some plugins that I personality edited to add the features of those plugins to the BOTs. I'm using these edited plugins on a Local Server because on a public server I'll get a Token ban.

I edited the following plugins.

# [SQL Matches](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=312488)
- The following is now added to the database
  - Team names from mp_teamname_1 and mp_teamname_2
  - Total damage in a match
  - Total 5k in a match
  - Total 4k in a match
  - Total 3k in a match
- The following is no longer added to the database
  - SteamIDs
  - Players from Spectators and with No team selected
  - Players alive
  - Money
  - Ping
  - Assists
  - MVPs
  - Score

# [hallucinogenic/MatchMaking-Ranks-By-Points](https://github.com/hallucinogenic/MatchMaking-Ranks-By-Points)
- Made it so that it doesn't skip BOTs
- Added all Official CS:GO ranks from every gamemode
- Replaced Overlays with end game rank up animation

# Other Files

There's an improved BotProfile.db I've edited that is a mix of the one made by [tNzxX](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Bots-release#announcements/detail/1805285903706432497) and the other made by [lolznoboz](https://gamebanana.com/scripts/10308).

I also added all the NavMeshes of my maps and all the team logos I currently have.
